# 6T-SRAM-Operations
Design and simulation of a CMOS-based 6T SRAM cell focusing on Read, Write, and Hold operations along with peripheral circuits using LTSpice.

📌Overview
Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is a high-speed, volatile memory technology used in digital systems to store frequently accessed data and instructions close to the processor. Unlike Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), which stores data as charge on capacitors and requires periodic refresh cycles, SRAM stores information using a bistable latch formed by cross-coupled CMOS inverters. This latch-based structure allows SRAM to retain its stored value as long as power is applied, without the need for refresh operations, resulting in significantly lower access latency and simpler control logic.

SRAM is widely preferred in performance-critical applications such as CPU cache memory, register files, and embedded systems due to its fast read and write capability, strong noise immunity, and stable data retention. Although SRAM occupies more silicon area and is more expensive per bit compared to DRAM, its superior speed and reliability make it the memory of choice where system performance and real-time operation are more important than storage density and cost.
